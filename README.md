**To run the code**

You need to install chrome driver, selenium, beautiful soup, webbrowser and the request package for python.

There might be some bugs in the code that I did not notice. If you find any, make an issue on gitHub.

**FIND ANY JOB**

*In the code change:*

    JOB_TITLE = "Developer"
    
    JOB_LOCATION = "Winnipeg, MB"
